# OOP and Unit-Testing
In this work you should finish following tasks:

1. Create a directory named "**app**" to contain the source code we discussed in class!
2. Prepare a Python environment and install the required dependency Python packages in "requirements.txt"
3. Write your own test cases in those provided scripts in "**tests**" folder.
4. Be aware you are NOT allowed to delete or add new functions but only edit the current ones.
5. Git push it back when you finished all files and coding.

P.S. Remember to use local "**_pytest --pylint_**" command to doublecheck if everything is fine at local.

After the submission, you can click the "Action" tab on this Github repo to view your grade.
